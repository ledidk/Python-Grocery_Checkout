# Python-Grocery_Checkout
- Products and Prices - Grocery Checkout System -

This Python script, `script1.py`, simulates a simple grocery checkout system. It calculates the total price of items purchased by a customer and displays the individual prices of each product, along with the subtotal, sales tax, and the total amount to pay.

## Products and Prices

- Apples: $1 each
- Eggs: $0.25 each
- Bread: $2.50 each
- Meat: $10 per pound
- Orange Juice: $2 per litre

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python (version 3 or higher) installed on your system.

2. Save the `script1.py` file to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `script1.py`.

##  Run the script using using PyCharm or using your terminal:


1. The script will prompt you to input the quantity of each product you wish to purchase.

2. Enter the quantities as integers for apples, bread, and orange juice, and as a float (decimal number) for eggs and meat.

3. The script will then calculate and display the individual prices for each product, as well as the subtotal, sales tax, and the total amount to pay.

4. The sales tax is currently set to 13% (0.13). You can modify this value if your region has a different sales tax rate.

5. After displaying the total amount to pay, the script will print a "Thank you!" message.

## Example

How many apples do you wish to purchase today? 3
How many eggs do you wish to purchase today? 12
How many bread do you wish to purchase today? 2

Your sub_total is: $ 34.0
